```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Visualizing the sequences

First, of course, we'll have to load some libraries: 

```{r libraries}

library(arulesSequences)
library(arulesViz)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

Alright, so let's see what data is available to visualize. I'll just be exploring, here, so let's start with checking out what methods are available for the `sequences` class: 

```{r check_methods}

methods(class = "sequences")

```
