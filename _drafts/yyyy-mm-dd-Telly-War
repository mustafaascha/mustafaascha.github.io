### Estranged

My name is Mustafa, but I'm a white guy who was born in a suburban Cleveland hospital that was subsumed by the nearest giant healthcare organization. I learned how to speak Arabic before English, and started my academic career at a Catholic school. People speak Arabic around me thinking that I don't understand (though, admittedly, I stopped learning it at the kindergarten level), and ask me "Where I'm from" when they find out my name. I feel like a walking contradiction, sometimes. 

This doesn't make me unique, though it does give me a unique perspective. 

### Communication science

Communication: feelings and vocalization vs ideas and words

Most parents and children have communication issues at some point, but I'm confident that my communication issues are exponentially greater because my Arabic is worse than that of my parents (but my English is better than theirs). I prefer to speak with them in Arabic, but I just don't know enough for them to sufficiently express themselves to me. Similarly, my Dad prefers to speak with me in English, though I'm sure sometimes he could express himself better in Arabic. 

Communication transcends language, though. It's the nonverbal cues that have helped me understand my parents' political views, especially when I'm so lost as to reduce the message to a binary good-vs-bad.
