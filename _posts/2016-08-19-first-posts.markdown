This is my first post, and I've been on a long run pretty much all day setting this site up. I'm pretty happy with the progress I've made, but the truth is I don't even know if it will build. 

If you're reading this message, it means that I succeeded. This isn't too difficult a framework to use for web development (I assume), but I'm still happy because it's my first website--ever. 

In any case, <a href="mailto:mustafa.ascha@gmail.com" text="drop me a line for some encouragement!">
