Making coffee in the office
-------------------------------------

When I arrived at the coffee machine today, I came to the realization: whenever I want coffee, the pot usually seems empty. I realized that there could be a couple of reasons why this is the case:

1. The coffee pot is empty more frequently than my cup is full  
2. I check the coffee pot more frequently than my coworkers  
3. There is a wizard magically disappearing (tr. v,) the coffee after I make it

Number 1 is unverifiable, unless I go to the trouble of setting up a camera pointed at the coffee pot. Alternatively, I could ask my coworkers when the coffee pot is full, but that would be a more direct way to demonstrate that I'm obsessive. Number 2 is similarly invasive in verifiability. Number 3 is also unverifiable, because office wizards are invisible.

Though I wouldn't want verifiability to interfere in finding some measure of truth, I'll go ahead and suggest that I think the answer lies in an assumption made for numbers 1 and 2--that I like coffee. More specifically, I like coffee more than my coworkers. They have remarked on this, though I always shrugged it off as playful banter. This is a coming-of-age story about how I realized I love coffee. Just kidding. 

Because I like coffee more than my coworkers, I am more likely to make coffee. Making coffee takes a little effort, the cost of which I am happy to endure. My coworkers like coffee, but not as much as I do. So, they are simultaneously less likely to make coffee than I am but just as likely to pour a cup of coffee (because they don't have to actually make coffee). 

Cleaning an apartment with roommates
---------------------------------------

I think that cleaning is pretty annoying, so I am reluctant to do it. I would rather maintain a clean-enough environment, taking less effort at one time but not addressing things like dusting. 

A roommate of mine in college hated dirty environments, and was willing to pick up after me if I left anything around for more than a day. 

You can probably see where this is going. One day, he was a bit peeved, and expressed anger at me for not cleaning. 

His preference for a clean room was greater than mine, especially when considering the time aspect of "having a clean room". So, his decision to clean was marginal with respect to my own...though I'm not sure the term applies in a two-agent system. 

Agent-based systems
--------------------

These situations are probably common to many people, but they're great for illustrating the interaction of agents in a system. Whether described statistically, economically, or computer-scientifically, these sorts of cases are be described well in the context of agents and systems.
