# The problem: homogenization

[Fad diets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad_diet) probably help people feel better, not just psychologically, but also physiologically because they demand a pointed shift in metabolic network gene expression. By imposing this variability, we are "exercising" our metabolism. 

With globalization and a rise in agricultural output, we have provided ourselves the fodder to choose whatever food it is that we like. We can celebrate food that is bad for us, or eat a lot of food that is good for us, but either way the instinctive obsessiveness that we have can be misleading. This obsessiveness is a symptom of the tragedy of complexity, whereby individuals are excessively curious because a single death is irrelevant with respect to the benefit of our race. The people who first ate our agricultural staples were literally risking their lives, assuming they knew there was a notable chance that the staples would be deadly. Of course, grains are not brightly colored or attention-getting, so maybe that's not the best evolutionary example. The idea easily maps from grains to fruits. 

The problem is that, whatever idea we have in mind, that is our guiding principle. We can use many guiding principles in parallel, but the weight of a guiding principle is proportional to the attention that it has. We are, in fact, wired to obsess because the survival of our species depends on it. 

Diet is a complicated and important enough question, for example, that we give it a lot of thought. Those of us who have intellectual faith in our peers will, then, quickly be duped when asked: Do we eat like the people who evolved into humans millions of years ago, or do we eat like the people who evolved into humans today? 

This is a complex problem, requiring the integration of several disciplines using both broad and deep tools. For an instantaneous human thinking about the issue, a guiding hand is welcome. 

So, when we fail to engage in fad diets, ignoring our obsessiveness, we may actually be behaving against our nature. Of course it depends on the individual at hand, but introducing variability in complex metabolic networks strikes me as a Good Thing.
