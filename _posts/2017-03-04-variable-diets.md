# The problem: homogenization

[Fad diets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad_diet) probably help people feel better, not just psychologically, but also physiologically because they demand a pointed shift in metabolic network gene expression. By imposing this variability, we are "exercising" our metabolism.  

With globalization and a rise in agricultural output, we have provided ourselves the fodder to choose whatever food it is that we like. We can celebrate food that is bad for us, or eat a lot of food that is good for us, but either way the instinctive obsessiveness that we have can be misleading. This obsessiveness is a symptom of the tragedy of complexity, whereby individuals are excessively curious because a single death is irrelevant with respect to the benefit of our race.  

The people who first ate our agricultural staples were literally risking their lives, assuming they knew there was a notable chance that the staples would be deadly. Of course, grains are not brightly colored or attention-getting, so maybe that's not the best evolutionary example. The idea easily maps from grains to fruits.  

Diet is a complicated and important enough question, for example, that we give it a lot of thought. Those of us who have intellectual faith in our peers will, then, quickly be duped when asked: Do we eat like the people who evolved into humans millions of years ago, or do we eat like the people who evolved into humans today?  

This is a complex problem, requiring the integration of several disciplines using both broad and deep tools. For an instantaneous human thinking about the issue, a guiding hand is welcome.  

In the interest of not seeming crazy, I'll use a recently-developed field to illustrate the point. Grains grow really well--well enough that farmers could lobby for corn subsidies in a time when money distribution didn't yet follow a power law, and [ancient americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Mesoamerica) relied heavily on the same crop. Obviously, I'm american. 

Too much of a good thing can cause discomfort, and the most immediate goal for any person is to avoid discomfort. So, in the past, rather than recognize gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it was easy to label a wheat allergy as food preference. This wasn't a problem, though, because people could just eat some other grain. 

Unfortunately, wheat is prevalent, and its immunological implications are inescapable because gluten is a glue for foods. When I wrote "recently-developed", I was referring mostly to immunology :) but allow me to point out: humans are remarkably well-adapted to their environment. This is probably a cognitive evolutionary leap, and I would conjecture the genes are on the sex chromosomes. There's a really big part of me that wonders if (1) celiac disease is largely found in women and (2) our recent cognitive leap is immunological in nature. Then again, this might just be because I dated a woman with celiac disease. 

In any case, when we fail to engage in fad diets, ignoring our obsessiveness, we may actually be behaving against our nature. Of course it depends on the individual at hand, but introducing variability in complex metabolic networks strikes me as a Good Thing.  

On a wholly separate note, this post is meant to be a writing sample.
