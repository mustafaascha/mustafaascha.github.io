# The problem: homogenization

[Fad diets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad_diet) probably help people feel better, not just psychologically, but also physiologically because they demand a pointed shift in metabolic network gene expression. By imposing this variability, we are "exercising" our metabolism.  

With globalization and a rise in agricultural output, we have provided ourselves the fodder to choose whatever food it is that we like. We can celebrate food that is bad for us, or eat a lot of food that is good for us, but either way the instinctive obsessiveness that we have can be misleading. As an aside, I hypothesize that this obsessiveness is a symptom of the tragedy of complexity, whereby individuals are excessively curious because a single death is irrelevant with respect to the benefit of our race. For example, the people who first ate any given foodstuffs were literally risking their lives, assuming they knew there was a notable chance that the food could be deadly.

Diet is a particularly complicated and important enough question that we give it a lot of thought, putting it into a modern-day context. Those of us who have intellectual faith in our peers will, then, likely accept assumptions of the question: Do we eat like the people who evolved into humans millions of years ago, or do we eat like the people who evolved into humans today?  

This is a complex problem, requiring the integration of several disciplines using both broad and deep tools. For an individual thinking about the issue, a guiding hand is welcome.  

I'll use a recently-developed field to illustrate the idea that, perhaps, our sources of nutrition are diverse. Grains grow really well--well enough that farmers could lobby for corn subsidies in a time when money distribution didn't yet exactly follow a power law, and [ancient americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Mesoamerica) relied heavily on the same crop. Obviously, I'm american. 

Too much of a good thing can cause discomfort, and the most immediate goal for any person is to avoid discomfort. So, in the past, rather than recognize gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it was easy to label a wheat allergy as food preference. This wasn't a problem, though, because people could just eat some other grain. 

Unfortunately, wheat is prevalent, and its immunological implications are inescapable because gluten is such a common glue for foods. When I wrote "recently-developed", I was referring mostly to immunology, but allow me to point out: humans are remarkably well-adapted to their environment, having a wide variety of "niches". This probably reflects some evolutionary advantage, one of the most variable pathways of which is immunological, and, by transitivity, metabolic. 

In any case, when we fail to engage in fad diets, ignoring the ease with which we adopt novelty, we may actually be behaving against our nature. Of course it depends on the individual at hand, but introducing variability in complex metabolic networks strikes me as a Good Thing.  

On a wholly separate note, this post is largely conjecture and meant to be a writing sample.
