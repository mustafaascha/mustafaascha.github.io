<h2>About me</h2>

<p> I'm <strong>Mustafa Ascha</strong>, a PhD student in Clinical and Translational Science at the Center for Clinical Investigation and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at <a href="http://www.case.edu/" target="_blank">Case Western Reserve University</a>.</p>

<p> To sum up my interests, I like to make things work. If I had a dremel when I was a kid, I would probably sand down a square peg to fit a round hole. Nowadays, I like to make information fit models: healthcare data (sequences analyses blog post to come), <a href="http://mustafa.fyi/blog/2016/08/21/CustomQisan" target="_blank"> arbitrary digital data </a>, analog signals (guitar effects post to come).</p>

<p>To see a more comprehensive list of my work, <a href="http://mustafa.fyi/assets/Ascha_CV.pdf", target = "_blank"> check out my CV</a> <a href="http://github.com/mustafaascha", target="_blank"> or my github.</a> </p>
