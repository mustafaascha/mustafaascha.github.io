<h2>About me</h2>

<p> I'm <strong>Mustafa Ascha</strong>, a PhD student in Clinical and Translational Science at the Center for Clinical Investigation and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at <a href="http://www.case.edu/" target="_blank">Case Western Reserve University</a>.</p>

<p> To sum up my interests, I like to make things work. I would probably sand down a square peg to fit a round hole if I had dremel when I was a kid. Nowadays, I like to make information fit models: healthcare data (sequences analysis blog post to come), digital signals (keyboard construction post to come), analog signals (guitar effects post to come).</p>
