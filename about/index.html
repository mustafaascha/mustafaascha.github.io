<h2>About me</h2>

<p> I'm <strong>Mustafa Ascha</strong>, a PhD student in Clinical and Translational Science at the Center for Clinical Investigation and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at <a href="http://www.case.edu/" target="_blank">Case Western Reserve University</a>. I have a wide range of interests, but my research interests involve the use of electronic health records and billing claims to produce actionable intelligence for medical professionals.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics with a minor in Philosophy and a Master's in Medical Physiology, both from Case Western Reserve University. Since I was an undergraduate, I've been interested in the process of making sense of evidence. When I was an undergraduate, I wanted to learn about modeling--but that is a general pursuit, so I was forced to choose to study how we model the distribution of resources. As a Master's student, I studied how we model human biological function. Now, I'm studying how to best model the application of resource distribution to human biology.</p>

<p>I've done some work related to my areas of interest, but I'll only share two projects here. My first publication was in 2009, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20209604" target="_blank"> a paper that reviewed rates of liver cancer in patients who do not have a history of alcoholism or viral infection</a>. This publication has over five hundred and fifty citations, which is probably because the cancer-causing condition is on the rise. I'm really lucky my mentor is smart and had great intuition for what's important. I did the data collection and preparation, and wrote/edited the article itself. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26839639" target="_blank">The second article that I'm happy was published is a review of immunosuppression after liver transplantation.</a>. I had to learn a lot to write this article, it was pretty awesome. This is from 2016, with an author who I met during that first study from 2009. Again, this article addresses growing public health issues, specifically the impact of immunosuppressants on diabetes and kidney disease.</p>

<p>There are a couple more articles going out that should better reflect my research interests. I only started really learning R last year, but since then have become enamored by R and computer science, generally. I was always a tinkerer, installing different linux distributions just to see what happens, but R has really been a perfect storm for my interest in modeling and tinkering.</p>
